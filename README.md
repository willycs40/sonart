# sonart
A computer vision controller for Sonos and Spotify

# Purpose
This project allows me to hold up a record cover to a camera, and have the album automatically start playing on my Sonos speakers.
It works using the OpenCV computer vision library and SimpleCV python module to recognise album covers from camera stills, and the SoCo python module to control Sonos.
